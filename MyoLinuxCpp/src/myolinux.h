/** \mainpage
 * This is the documentation for a C++ library for interfacing with the Myo armband on Linux.
 * This implementation uses the bled112 dongle that is included with the device. The dongle operates over a serial
 * port, here abstracted as a \link myolinux::Serial Serial \endlink class. Three protocols are needed for the
 * communication with the device, each of is implemented in a separate namespace myolinux::bled112, myolinux::gatt and
 * myolinux::myo.
 *
 * For general use only constructs defined in the \ref myolinux are needed.
 */

/** \defgroup myolinux Myo for Linux
 * Constructs needed for communication with the Myo device.
 *
 * All communication with the device is done using the myolinux::myo::Client class, all other
 * constructs are only needed as arguments or are returned by a member function.
 *
 * For a simple example look at main.cpp file.

/** The main namespace.
 * It contains all symbols defined in this project, which prevents the pollution of the global scope. Generally
 * it is fine to introduce them into the file scope by a using-directive, as the majority of the library is
 * contained inside the \ref bled112, \ref gatt and \ref myo sub-namespaces.
 *
 * It directly contains all general helper constructs: \ref Buffer, \ref Serial.
 *
 * By default it is named myolinux, however to avoid any namespace clashes it can be renamed by defining the
 * MYOLINUX_NAMESPACE at compile time. Please note that programs using a different global namespace name are not
 * compatible, therefore the library has to be distributed with the program in that case.
